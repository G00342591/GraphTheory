# GraphTheory


Design Choices:
I chose to use an input with this project in order to provide a more realistic touch to it, allowing you to input any String/Infix without having to manually edit it in the code. Design was based off the videos provided by the lecturers in this Module.

As I am on Python version 2.7.11 I had to use raw_input() because it doesn't convert the input to python and takes the input as given. If using python 3 or higher this will have to be changed to input() as raw_input() is replaced by it.

Attached to the assingment is a png of the code being marked as an error despite functioning. This is due to the raw_input() function being called but the code does work itself.

Code is executed using  C:\python27\python.exe shunt.py
